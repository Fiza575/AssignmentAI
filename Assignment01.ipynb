    "***How AI Helps:***\n",
    "\n",
    "AI is used to analyze medical images (like X-rays, MRIs, and mammograms) faster and more accurately than humans in some cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For example**, in breast cancer, AI can detect tiny lumps or patterns in mammograms that doctors might miss.\n",
    " AI systems can also predict risk by looking at patient data and history.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "***Real-World Example:***\n",
    "\n",
    "Google Health and DeepMind (UK) developed an AI that detects breast cancer better than human radiologists in some studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hospitals in the US and Europe are already using similar tools to support doctors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "***Benefit:***\n",
    "\n",
    "Faster diagnosis\n",
    "\n",
    "More accurate results\n",
